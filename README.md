 Project 3 - Interactive Form

--Description
This app displays a form requiring basic information and providing interactive form elements, and form validation. The form works only on the front-end (it does not submit) and the page simply refreshes when the form is submitted. This form provides real-time and dynamic form validation and error messages, and dynamically hidden drop-down menus.

--Skills and Process
Project 3 demonstrates use of jquery (to select and manipulation elements in the DOM) and javascript regular expressions (to validate form information before submission).
