# TechDegree Project 2
 Project 3 - Interactive Form

--Description
Project 3 displays a form requiring basic information, interactive form elements, and form validation. The form works only on the front-end (it does not submit) and the page simply refreshes when the form is submitted. This form provides real-time and dynamic form validation and error messages, and dynamically hidden drop-down menus.

--Skills and Process
Project 3 demonstrates use of jquery (to select and manipulation elements in the DOM) and javascript regular expressions (to validate form information before submission).

--Project Attempt
Exceeds Expectations
1. "Color" drop down menu is hidden until t-shirt design is selected
2. Real time error messages enabled as user types
3. Dynamic error messages that assist users in entering valid form information (added without HTML5's built-in field-validation)
